# Job Trends Data Pipeline

This project analyzes job listing data to uncover insights about skills, salaries, and remote work trends. It features a Python data pipeline that cleans raw job data and produces visualizations to help understand the job market better.

## Project Overview

- Load raw job listings data from CSV
- Clean and normalize salary data
- Identify remote job postings
- Extract key skill indicators (Python, SQL, Excel)
- Bucket salaries into meaningful ranges
- Generate visualizations for salary distribution and skill demand

## Features Implemented So Far

- Data cleaning with `transform.py`
- Skill extraction (Python, SQL, Excel)
- Seniority level detection from job titles
- Remote job parsing and flagging
- Interactive dashboard with Streamlit for exploration and visualization

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    
    "python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate"

3. Install dependencies:
  
    "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
  
4. Run the interactive dashboard (data is loaded directly from Google Drive):
    
    "streamlit run app.py"
   

**Note:** The file `explore.py` has been renamed to `app.py` to support the Streamlit dashboard.
